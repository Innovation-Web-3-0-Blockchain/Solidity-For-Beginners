1. **Visit Ethereum Remix**:
   - Visit the [Ethereum Remix IDE Website](https://remix.ethereum.org/) to begin.

2. **Import the Smart Contract**:
   - Import the smart contract named `Counter.sol`. in the [Contract Repository](../contracts) You can do this by either uploading the file or copying and pasting the code into Remix.

   **Note:** For a better understanding of the code within the `Counter.sol` contract, please see our [Contracts Explanation Documentation](../Contracts-Explanation/COUNTER_CONTRACT_EXPLANATION.md).

3. **Compile the Smart Contract**:
   - After importing the contract, click the "Compile" button in Remix. This step allows the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to understand the code.

4. **Ignore Warnings**:
   - During compilation, you might see warnings or messages. You can ignore them for this basic tutorial.

5. **View Bytecode**:
   - In Remix, you can view the bytecode of your smart contract. This bytecode represents the contract's code in a machine-readable format. It doesn't require any action but is useful for understanding the contract's inner workings.

6. **Deploy the Contract**:
   - Click the "Deploy" button in Remix. This will create an instance of your contract on the Ethereum blockchain.
   - Use an Ethereum virtual machine (VM) environment account with at least 100 ethers to cover gas fees.

7. **Transaction Confirmation**:
   - If the deployment is successful, you will receive a transaction hash as confirmation.
   - Your account balance will be reduced by a small amount (less than 1 ether) due to gas fees.

8. **Interact with the Contract**:
   - Under the "Deployed Contracts" section, you should see your deployed contract. It will have two tabs for the functions you defined in your contract.

9. **Get the Count**:
   - Click on the "getCount" function. This function reads the count stored on the blockchain and doesn't cost any gas.
   - You should see a count of 0 displayed, which is the initial state of the contract.

10. **Increment the Count**:
    - Click on the "incrementCount" function. This will create a transaction and change the state of the blockchain, so you'll have to pay gas fees for this action.
    - After confirming the transaction, your count will increase by 1.

11. **Get the Count Again**:
    - Click on the "getCount" function once more. This time, you should see a count of 1, as it reflects the change you made by incrementing it.

That's it! You've successfully deployed and interacted with your first basic smart contract using Remix. You can head to the next lesson by clicking this link: [Variables and Data Types](VariablesAndDataTypes.md)
