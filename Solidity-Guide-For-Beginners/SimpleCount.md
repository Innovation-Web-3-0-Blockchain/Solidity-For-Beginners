# Solidity Counter for Beginners

In this guide, we'll walk you through the basics of counting in Solidity.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following:

1. **Visit Ethereum Remix**:
   - Visit the [Ethereum Remix IDE Website](https://remix.ethereum.org/) to begin.

2. **Import the Smart Contract**:
   - Import the smart contract named `Counter.sol` from the [Contract Repository](../contracts). You can do this by either uploading the file or copying and pasting the code into Remix.

   - **Note:** For a better understanding of the code within the `Counter.sol` contract, please see our [Contracts Explanation Documentation](../Contracts-Explanation/COUNTER_CONTRACT_EXPLANATION.md).

## Getting Started

1. **Compile the Smart Contract**:
   - After importing the contract, click the "Compile" button in Remix. This step allows the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to understand the code.

2. **Ignore Warnings**:
   - During compilation, you might encounter warnings or messages. For this basic tutorial, you can ignore them.

3. **View Bytecode**:
   - In Remix, you can view the bytecode of your smart contract. This bytecode represents the contract's code in a machine-readable format. While it doesn't require any action, it's useful for understanding the contract's inner workings.

4. **Deploy the Contract**:
   - Click the "Deploy" button in Remix. This will create an instance of your contract on the Ethereum blockchain.
   - Use an Ethereum virtual machine (VM) environment account with 100 ethers to cover gas fees.

5. **Transaction Confirmation**:
   - Upon successful deployment, you will receive a transaction hash as confirmation.
   - Your account balance will be reduced by a small amount (less than 1 ether) due to gas fees.

6. **Interact with the Contract**:
   - Under the "Deployed Contracts" section, you should see your deployed contract, with tabs for the functions defined in your contract.

7. **Get the Count**:
   - Click on the "getCount" function. This function reads the count stored on the blockchain and doesn't incur any gas fees.
   - You should see a count of 0 displayed, representing the initial state of the contract.

8. **Increment the Count**:
    - Click on the "incrementCount" function. This action creates a transaction and changes the state of the blockchain, requiring payment of gas fees.
    - After confirming the transaction, your count will increase by 1.

9. **Get the Count Again**:
    - Click on the "getCount" function once more. This time, you should see a count of 1, reflecting the change made by incrementing it.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully deployed and interacted with your first basic Solidity smart contract using Remix. Throughout this lesson, you've learned the fundamentals of counting in Solidity, from deployment to interacting with functions. You've become familiar with essential concepts such as deploying contracts, handling gas fees, and executing functions.
