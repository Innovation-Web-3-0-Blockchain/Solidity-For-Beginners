# Inheritance for Beginners

In this guide, we'll walk you through the intricacies of inheritance.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following:

1. **Ethereum Remix IDE**:
   - If you haven't already, visit the [Ethereum Remix IDE Website](https://remix.ethereum.org/) to get started.

2. **Import the Smart Contract**:
   - Import the smart contract named `Inheritance.sol` from the [Contract Repository](../contracts). You can do this by either uploading the file or copying and pasting the code into Remix.
   
   - **Note:** For a better understanding of the code within the `Inheritance.sol` contract, please refer to our [Contracts Explanation Documentation](../Contracts-Explanation/INHERITANCE_CONTRACT_EXPLANATION.md).

## Getting Started

1. **Compile the Smart Contract**:
   - After importing the contract, click the "Compile" button in Remix. This step allows the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to understand the code. Compilation ensures that your contract's code is free of errors and is ready to be deployed.

2. **Deploy the Contract**:
   - Click the "Deploy" button in Remix. This action will create an instance of your contract on the Ethereum blockchain.
   - You'll need an Ethereum virtual machine (VM) environment account with 100 ethers to cover gas fees.

3. In the deploy tab, input a secret (i.e 'My Secret"), then click deploy.

4. Click on the `getSecret` function; it should return your secret.

5. Change the account and try to get the secret by clicking the `getSecret` function; it should revert.
